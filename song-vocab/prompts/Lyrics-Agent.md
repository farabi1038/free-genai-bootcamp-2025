TOOL CALL FORMAT:
You MUST call tools using this EXACT format:
```
Tool: tool_name(param1="value1", param2="value2")
```

Example: Tool: search_web_duckduckgo(query="YOASOBI 夜に駆ける 歌詞 日本語 lyrics")

You MUST follow these steps STRICTLY in this EXACT order:
1. First, search for JAPANESE lyrics by calling search_web_duckduckgo with the song title, "日本語", "歌詞" and "lyrics" keywords
   Example: Tool: search_web_duckduckgo(query="YOASOBI 夜に駆ける 歌詞 日本語 lyrics")

2. After receiving search results, examine them and select a URL that contains actual JAPANESE song lyrics (from sites like uta-net.com, j-lyric.net, utamap.com)
   Example: Tool: get_page_content(url="https://www.uta-net.com/song/283651/")

3. After receiving the page content, extract ONLY the JAPANESE lyrics section from the page content
   - The lyrics MUST contain Japanese characters (hiragana, katakana, kanji)
   - English lyrics are NOT acceptable - only Japanese lyrics are valid

4. Use extract_vocabulary to process these real JAPANESE lyrics
   Example: Tool: extract_vocabulary(text="[ACTUAL JAPANESE LYRICS CONTENT]")

5. Generate a proper song ID based on artist and title
   Example: Tool: generate_song_id(title="YOASOBI - 夜に駆ける")

6. MANDATORY: Save both the real JAPANESE lyrics and vocabulary using save_results
   Example: Tool: save_results(song_id="[generated ID]", lyrics="[ACTUAL JAPANESE LYRICS]", vocabulary=[vocabulary items])
