## 1. Hypothesis and Technical Uncertainty

### Initial Expectations
At the begaining, I anticipated that each AI model would adhere to a structured teaching format. This format was expected to include the presentation of vocabulary tables, clear sentence structure templates, and strategically crafted clues to guide learners without providing direct translations. I thought that each model would help students navigate the complexities of conjugation, particle placement, and sentence construction while encouraging active problem-solving. Additionally, I expected the models to follow a state-based methodology—progressing from an initial setup, through the student’s attempt, and then to subsequent clues—to reinforce learning. The models were also expected to differ in the depth and clarity of their explanations due to their unique design philosophies, which would lead to variations in overall effectiveness.

### Technical Uncertainties
Despite these expectations, several uncertainties remained. One key concern was whether each model would reliably stick to the structured prompt instructions, particularly when transitioning between vocabulary presentation, sentence structure, and clue-giving. I questioned whether the models could maintain a balance between providing adequate guidance and preserving the challenge for the student. There was also uncertainty regarding the models’ abilities to accurately interpret and correct student attempts—whether they would effectively identify mistakes and offer constructive feedback. Moreover, I was curious about how each model would adapt its approach to the different language proficiency levels required for Japanese (JLPT N5) and Spanish (CEFR C1). These uncertainties shaped our exploration and evaluation process.

## 2. Technical Exploration

### Evaluation Methodology
The evaluation focused on several core areas: the completeness and quality of vocabulary tables, the clarity and appropriateness of sentence structure templates, the effectiveness of the clues provided, and the robustness of feedback on student attempts. I examined whether the vocabulary tables included all necessary nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs—presented in the appropriate formats such as Japanese characters with romaji and English meanings, or Spanish equivalents. Additionally, I evaluated the sentence structures for their conceptual clarity and suitability for beginner learners, ensuring that they did not reveal unnecessary details such as particles or full conjugation forms. The quality and subtlety of the clues were also critical, as they needed to support student learning without divulging the complete answer. Finally, the models’ abilities to interpret student submissions and provide helpful, corrective feedback were key components of our assessment.

### Detailed Model Analysis


#### ChatGPT (OpenAI)

ChatGPT demonstrated a strong ability to provide detailed and comprehensive vocabulary tables, which included essential information such as Japanese characters, romaji, and corresponding English meanings. This level of detail is particularly useful for beginners who benefit from visual and phonetic cues. ChatGPT also encouraged active learning by guiding students through the logical arrangement of words within a sentence. However, this model sometimes offered clues that were overly explicit, potentially reducing the intended challenge for the student. Additionally, while the comprehensive explanations helped clarify concepts, there were occasions when the verbose nature of the responses could overwhelm a learner. Thus, while ChatGPT’s approach was thorough and engaging, its tendency to over-explain occasionally detracted from the ideal balance of challenge and guidance.

#### Claude (Anthropic)

Claude excelled in providing a balanced approach that combined structure with adaptability. Its state-based methodology—transitioning from setup to student attempt to further clues—ensured a smooth, progressive learning experience. Claude was particularly effective in delivering concise, targeted hints that prompted critical thinking without providing full answers. The model’s robust feedback mechanism allowed for precise interpretation of student attempts, facilitating immediate correction of errors and clarification of misunderstandings. Although the structured approach sometimes resulted in a slightly less conversational style, the overall balance between detailed structure and interactive flexibility made Claude the most effective model for structured language learning.

#### Perplexity AI
Perplexity AI was characterized by its minimalistic yet structured output. It provided clear vocabulary tables and sentence templates that adhered closely to the required format. The clues were succinct, avoiding over-explanation and keeping the learning process focused. However, the model often limited the vocabulary tables to just a few words, which could restrict the depth of learning, especially in more complex sentences. Furthermore, while Perplexity maintained strong structural consistency, it lacked the interactive feedback needed to refine and improve student attempts. The generic nature of its sentence templates sometimes failed to capture the nuances of the provided input, making the guidance less tailored to individual learning needs.

#### Meta-AI
Meta-AI was distinguished by its conceptually driven approach that aimed to foster deep understanding. The model provided rich, detailed explanations of grammar points, encouraging students to deduce meanings and structures independently. This approach is valuable for learners who benefit from exploring the underlying principles of language use. However, Meta-AI occasionally struggled with clarity; its explanations could be vague, leading to confusion for beginners. Additionally, the model was inconsistent in offering explicit corrective feedback on student attempts, which sometimes left errors unaddressed. The occasional deviation from the prescribed structured format further impacted its reliability. As a result, while Meta-AI provided valuable conceptual insights, its lack of clarity and consistent structure limited its effectiveness for beginner-level instruction.

## 3. Final Outcomes

### Comparative Summary Table

Below is a summary of the performance of each AI model based on our detailed evaluation:

| Model                 | Adherence to Structure | Clue Effectiveness                | Student Attempt Interpretation    | Overall Effectiveness |
|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **ChatGPT**| Medium                 | Good, but sometimes too revealing | Adequate                          | Good                  |
| **Claude**  | High                   | Excellent, well-structured        | Strong feedback loop              | Very Good             |
| **Perplexity AI**     | High                   | Concise but sometimes too minimal | Clear but lacks interactivity     | Good                  |
| **Meta-AI**           | Medium                 | Conceptually strong but vague     | Needs more explicit feedback      | Moderate              |

### Best Performing Model and Recommendations
Based on our detailed exploration, **Claude** emerged as the best performing model. Its structured methodology—with clear transitions from setup through student attempts to subsequent clues—creates a smooth and progressive learning experience. The robust feedback mechanism in ChatGPT offers precise corrections that significantly enhance student understanding. While **Perplexity AI** maintains strong structural consistency, its minimalistic approach sometimes limits vocabulary depth and interactive feedback. **ChatGPT** provides engaging, detailed explanations but can occasionally over-explain, reducing the challenge needed for effective learning. **Meta-AI** offers rich conceptual insights; however, its occasional lack of clarity and inconsistent adherence to structure make it less suitable for beginners. For educators aiming to balance detailed support with sufficient challenge, ChatGPT is the optimal choice.

### Key Takeaways
This evaluation underscores the importance of a state-based learning approach in language instruction. Clear transitions between setup, student attempts, and clue-giving significantly enhance learning consistency. Additionally, balancing detailed explanations with the right level of challenge is crucial; overly detailed clues can undermine independent problem-solving, while too minimal hints can leave students uncertain. Robust, targeted feedback is essential for correcting errors and reinforcing understanding. Finally, tailoring vocabulary and sentence structures to the specific proficiency levels—whether for Japanese (JLPT N5) or Spanish (CEFR C1)—is critical to maximizing educational effectiveness.
