## Infrastructure Investment Plan

To maintain control over user data privacy and mitigate the rising costs of managed AI services, the company is opting to build its own AI infrastructure.

An investment of $10,000-$15,000 is allocated for a dedicated AI workstation.

The infrastructure will support 300 active students within the city of Nagasaki.

## Key Assumptions

- The selected open-source LLMs will be optimized to run efficiently within the defined hardware budget.
- A single in-house server will be connected to the internet, providing adequate bandwidth for the student base.

## Data Management Strategy

To prevent potential copyright infringement, all required learning materials will be legally acquired and stored securely in an internal database.

## AI Model Considerations

IBM Granite is a preferred choice due to its open-source framework, offering transparency in training data and reducing copyright-related risks.
